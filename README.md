The project aims to create a simple contact book application using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete contacts, providing an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for managing contact information.
Task to be done: 

Set Up the GUI: 

Initialize the main application window. 

Design the layout including labels, entry fields, buttons, and a listbox to display contacts. 

 

Implement Core Functions: 

Create functions to add new contacts, view selected contacts, update existing contacts, and delete contacts from the list. 

Implement data validation to ensure that users enter valid information before performing actions. 

Manage Contact List: 

Store contacts in a list format, allowing for easy manipulation (adding, updating, deleting). 

Sort and display the contact list in alphabetical order. 

Integrate User Feedback: 

Use message boxes to provide feedback for actions (confirmation messages for successful operations and error messages for invalid actions). 

Testing and Debugging: 

Ensure that all functionalities work correctly and handle edge cases (e.g., selecting a contact, empty input fields).
